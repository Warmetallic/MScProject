‘And join me in full chorus to sing brave Huntly's praise
Teft a girl behind me, the joy of all my pride,

My heart remains in Huntly and far frae Bogieside.

2. All you companions of my youth I bid you all adieu,
The pleasures of one evening walk I'll walk nae mair wi’ you,
For the pleasures I've enjoyed here shall in my heart abide
And I'll sing Farewell to Huntly and Adieu to Bogieside.

3. Oall ye comrades of my youth whose memory is most dear,
And while I think on parting I shed a solemn tear,
And while my heart it bears to beat till death does me divide
T'll sing Farewell to Huntly and Adieu to Bogieside,

4. It’s down the road to Huntly’s lodge with pleasant steps I trod
‘And much inspired with rapture to see the girl I oved
She choosed me in her rambles and choosed me for her guide,
‘To walk upon sweet Deveron’s banks and around sweet Rogicside.

5. How cheerfully we have wandered to hear the blackbirds sing,
Allin the merry month of May to see the young flowers spring
‘The sky being clear and bonnie all in an eveningtide
We set us down to rest awhile upon sweet Bogieside.
