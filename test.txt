8 Farewell to your sorrows, drink it round with a glass,
Drink a health to each lad, and his sweet smiling lass;
Drink a health to each lover whose loved one is true,
Here’s good health, peace and plenty, so farewell and adieu.

1 Come all my old comrades once more let us join,
Let us join all our voices to muse on langsyne,
Let us drink and be merry from sorrow refrain,
For we may and may never meet all here again.

2 The time is now approaching when I must away,
So I leave my best wishes with all you that stay,
May good fortune attend you who happy lives here,
For away to America my course I must steer.

THE EMIGRANT’S FAREWELL TO DONSIDE

A

 

1 Come, friends and acquaintances, once more let us join,
And raise our sweet voices in chorus wi’ mine;
Let us drink and be merry, from sorrow refrain,
For we may and may never meet all here again.
For we may and may never meet all here again.

2 Iance had a lassie, I liket her weel,
For modesty and beauty none could her excel;
When she looked in my face as she sat on my knee,
There were none in the world more happy than we.

3 The time is fast approaching when I must away;
Farewell to my comrades wherever you be;
And wherever I wander by land and by sea,

I’ll never forget all your kindness to me.

4 Yehills and low valleys of Donside, farewell,
For if ever I return there is none here can tell;
Farewell to your lasses of every degree,

Long in vain will I wish for your sweet company.

5 Farewell to the jewel, to you I love best,
For you and your beauty excel all the rest;
But if you prove constant, as constant can be,
Wherever I go, love, my heart is with thee.

6 Long may you be merry, while I’m very sad,
When I think of the pleasures that you and I’ve had;
When I mind on the times that you’ ve sat on my knee,
There were none in this world more happy than we.

7 The time has now arrivéd that I must away,
Cold winter is over, sweet summer draws nigh,
There is an old proverb, I believe it is true,
That “true love is more precious than the wealth of Peru.”

8 Farewell to your sorrows, drink it round with a glass,
Drink a health to each lad, and his sweet smiling lass;
Drink a health to each lover whose loved one is true,
Here’s good health, peace and plenty, so farewell and adieu.

Drink health to each lad and his sweet smiling lass,
Drink health to each lover whose loved one is true,

The Donside Emigrant’s Farewell

1 Come all ye dear comrades let us join here and sing
Once more let your voices join chorus with mine
Let us drink and be merry, all sorrows refrain
For we may and we may never all meet here again.

2 For the time is fast advancing that I must away
So I'll bid you all farewell for many a long day
Likewise my dear comrades so happy we have been here
Away to Virginia my course I maun steer.

3 Ye woods and green valleys I'll bid you farewell
If ever I return again there is no one can tell
Likewise you fair maidens of every degree
Long and sore have I wished for your kind company.

4 May the heavens protect us with a prosperous gale
And be our safeguard while we are under sail
Lead us safe to yon harbour oer the proud stormy wave
We will trust in his mercy who can sink and can save.

Many hearts does make merry while mine does make sad
To think on the pleasures me and my love has had

How she laughed at my folly as she sat on my knee

No couple on earth were so happy as we.

Farewell all my pleasures are gone for awhile

Cold winter is past and sweet summer does smile

But we have read in old Proverbs which was found to be true
That love is far better nor gold in Peru.

Here is a health to my darling to whom I love well
There is none in her station could with her excel
But if she proves still loyal, still constant I'll be
For my heart is still with you love wherever you be.

Come all my dear comrades, drink a care and a glass
Each lad drink a health to his darling sweet lass

May there mirth, peace and plenty still with you remain
May you never want a friend love till I come again.

Come All My Dear Comrades

Come all my dear comrades, let’s join here and sing
Come let all your voices join encore wi’ mine

Let us drink and be merry all sorrow refrain

For we may and may never meet here again.

The time’s fast advancing that I must away

I'll bid you adieu for many’s the long day

Wi’ you my dear comrades, so happy we’ve been here
But away to Virginia my course I must steer.

Ye woods and ye valleys I bid them farewell

If ever I come back again there is no one can tell
Likewise my fair maidens, for you my heart bleeds sore
Oh oft have I wished for your company more.

May Heaven protect us with a prosperous gale

And be our safeguard while we are under sail

Lead us safe to the harbour across the proud wave
We will trust to his mercy who can sink and can save.

Many hearts will be merry but mine will be sad
When I think on the joys that me and my love had
As she laughed at my follies and sat on my knee
No couple in this world were so happy as we.

Here’s a health to the lassie, that I lo’e so weel
There is more in her station that can with her excel
But if she proves true to me till I cross the sea

My heart shall be with her wherever she be.

Come all ye royal lovers and here let us join

Let us sing these few verses wi’ chorus

O mind let us drink and be merry from all hatred refrain
For we may and we may never all meet here again.

The time is just coming when I must away

To leave you all behind me for many a long day
Tis for my old comrades I’ve been so happy here
Away to strange countries my course I must steer.

Here’s a health to my mother wherever she be

May the heavens above keep her in both riches and love
_ Wherever I wander by land or by sea

I will always remember what she’s done for me.

Here’s a health to my sweetheart whom I love so well
For wit and for beauty there is none can excel

Many a heart will be merry when mine will be sad
When I think on the pleasures me and my lovie had.

I’ve read the old proverbs and found to be true
That love is more pleasant than the gold in Peru
That love is more pleasant than the gold in Peru
Farewell peace and plenty I bid thee adieu.

Let us drive away sorrows, drown tears in a glass
Let every young lover drink a health to his lass

Let us drink and be merry from all hatred refrain
For we may and we may never all meet here again.
